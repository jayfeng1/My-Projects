Wikipedia Box Office Predictor
===========

With an increasing reliance on technology and analytics now to predict outcomes, one industry that has had an increase in focus on prediction has been the movie and entertainment industry. Ways to measure success and returning value of marketing efforts on movies can be done with Twitter, Facebook, and other websites that showcase people's opinions in literal word of mouth display. That also means that buzz can be discovered on a movie by checking out how many people might search on Google for a movie as well as check a movie page on Wikipedia. Wikipedia, now the world's most used people edited encyclopedia has been used more frequently to check for dates of release of a film, budget size, cast and characters, and more. As an alternative to IMDB, Wikipedia is largely being used as a tool for people to check out movies and their background information. While it's pretty obvious that the more people search about a movie in Google the more often it's going to do well at the box office, but since Wikipedia has risen to almost always become the first or second result on Google, there most always can been a good correlation between page views of a wikipedia article and box office revenue. Other factors can include the initiation of a wikipedia article and also the seasons and date of release.
